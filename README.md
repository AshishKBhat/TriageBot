The timeline and progress of the project is in the [Worksheet Document](https://github.ncsu.edu/maalbash/DeveloperTriage/blob/master/WORKSHEET.md)

This is the [Design document](https://github.ncsu.edu/maalbash/DeveloperTriage/blob/master/FIXDESIGN.md "Design.md") for the project.

The first three use cases of our Developer Triage Bot are described in the [TriageBot_UseCases Document](https://github.ncsu.edu/maalbash/DeveloperTriage/blob/master/TriageBot_UseCases.md)
